# Leaf_Disease_Classification_Using_ViT_Transformer
This project classifies plant leaf diseases using the Vision Transformer (ViT) model. ViT processes images as sequences of patches, enabling high accuracy in image classification. The model aids early disease detection in crops, improving agricultural efficiency by reducing crop loss through precision farming.
